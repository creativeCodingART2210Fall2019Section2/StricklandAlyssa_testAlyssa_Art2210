I had a lot of trouble with this project. In the beginning, I wanted to complete a click and type game, because they were my favorite type of game to play as a child. but I realized that would be too much work and I wouldn’t be able to give it the proper amount of attention it needed to reach its full potential. So, I went with something considerably simpler, a click game with the sole purpose of racking up as many points as possible. While the game may seem considerably unfinished, I’m proud of what I managed to accomplish in the two week span that I had. The biggest obstacle for me when completing this project was understanding the code’s logic, getting from “a” to “b,” then creating my own. While my code does seem simple, I’m happy I understand it and can explain it if needed.
