My goal in this project was to illustrate a basic,  aesthetically pleasing cityscape. I began by taking inspiration from a few pixelated images and observed how they were able to create and beautiful scenes using only simple, geometric shapes. However, I didnâ€™t want to create an overly colorful scene, so I referenced a gray-scale image of a city and balcony. The neutral colors are meant to bring a more peaceful aura to the city. Any color added was used to accentuate reflection or light much later in the project.

For the foundation, I began with a bridge, using only black rectangles, so that it may be identified as the closest object within the composition. I created a simple body of water in dark grey under the bridge as a means to add contrast and make the bridge a bit more recognizable. Next, I created a series of buildings behind the bridge using only basic rectangles again. I used a series of lighter grayscale colors as a means to create depth, making the composition a bit more three-dimensional. Last was the sky, a simple gradient of rectangles I made, meaning to impersonate dark clouds. Any additional highlights or colors were added sporadically during the next part of my project.

The final and by far the most difficult part of the project was the rain array. I had to create the raindrop size, speed, and make sure the rain looped and updated properly. While it was tricky, I am pleased with the outcome. Compositionally, the rain is meant to add a sense of movement and completion to the picture as a whole. It is meant to add to the peacefulness and calming aesthetic as well.

Overall, I am very pleased with how this came out. Furthermore, I am glad I went for composition rather than a game, as I would have experienced much more difficulty and frustration when making the latter. Of course, there were some other aspects that I would have liked to have added in hindsight. For example, thunderstorm audio accompanied by flashes of lightning in the background; maybe even a clock. In any case, I had a lot of fun working on this project.
